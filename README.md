GIT Repository Location: https://github.com/katdivyareddy/crispin_mulberry.git

Fulfilled Requirements:


1.	Browser Support: Supports all major browsers, IE 7, 8, 9+. Tested support in IE9 on a windows vista machine by changing browser modes.
2.	Build Tools: None used.
3.	Framework: jQuery 1.11.1. No plugins/polyfills.
4.	Carousel: based on mouse enter and mouse leave with css selectors. It supports 4 images. Auto-rotates on page load and pauses when user interacts.
5.	Media: Images from PSD are used, Videos do not play.
6.	Twitter Widget: Used a tweet box with a limit of 3 latest posts.
7.	Ads: Static images are used.
8.	Forms: They don’t submit.
9.	Pixel perfection: Design matches PSD in all the browsers afore mentioned.
I was not sure if the carousels thumbnails could be made clickable. I have the code ready for it. If it is required, I will include it by passing the data-param from the image to the function on click event, which clears the timerinterval and passes “slideNumber” value to the function nextSlide();
I have also checked the code for markup validation on validator.w3.org – W3c validator.
